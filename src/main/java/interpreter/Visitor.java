/*!! Interpreter */

/*!
Visitor
=======

The interpreter (and the evaluator) are performing structural recursion on the inductive data structure `Program` and
`Expression`, respectively. We want to define one interpreter function that behaves differently depending on the
argument. In functional languages this is done with
[Pattern Matching](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pattern_Matching#Programmierung)
and in Java this is typically implemented using the
[Visitor Pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visitor_pattern).

/*! This `Visitor` is implemented using
[Reflection](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/articles/java/javareflection-1536171.html). That is kind of cheating, but simplifies
the classical Visitor pattern a lot. Of course the performance is bad, but performance is not an issue in this little
demonstration and actually there are a lot of other performance issues as well. */
